title: What is Sync
---
We at Tartan have developed the Sync platform to facilitate seamless employee data exchange between service providers and their clients (employers), specifically focusing on the efficient retrieval of employee information. Traditionally, clients (employers) manually shared updated employee data with service providers, leading to delays, errors, and inefficiencies. Sync addresses these challenges by enabling service providers to access their clients' (employer's) employee information directly and in real-time, thereby enhancing service delivery and operational scalability.

## Sync Use Cases
Sync can be applied across various business functions to enhance data integration and operational efficiency. Undermentioned are detailed use cases illustrating how Sync can be utilized:
<Steps>
<Step title="HyperSync">
HyperSync is a specialized platform within the Sync solution designed to streamline data sharing between organizations and their service providers across various sectors, including insurance, banking, and employee management. Traditionally, organizations updated their service providers about changes in employee details, such as promotions, terminations, or salary adjustments, manually, often via CSV files. This manual process is prone to errors and can lead to delays in service delivery.
HyperSync offers a solution by providing a unified API capable of integrating with over 70 different Human Resource Management Systems (HRMS). This integration allows service providers to securely connect with their clients’ HR systems and access updated employee information as needed. Organizations can select specific data points they are willing to share, ensuring data privacy and compliance. By eliminating the need for manual data transmission, HyperSync reduces errors and turnaround times, thereby enhancing efficiency and improving the reliability of information exchange.

</Step>
<Step title="SmartExpense API">
SmartExpense API is a financial data management solution within the Sync platform that automates the exchange of expense-related information between service providers and their clients (employers). Its core function is to transfer expense data from service providers in the format defined by the client. This means that regardless of the tools or systems a client uses, the SmartExpense API ensures that the expense data is delivered in the client's preferred format and with the necessary data fields.
In addition, the SmartExpense API supports real-time financial tracking, automated reconciliation, and compliance by securely integrating with accounting and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems. This automation not only minimizes manual intervention but also enhances operational efficiency and accuracy in financial reporting.
