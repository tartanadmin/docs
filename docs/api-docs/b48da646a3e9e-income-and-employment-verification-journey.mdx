## Verify your user in Real-time

Our product is available in two variants, **No-code and Low-code.** Through the No code solution, you can get started right away by accessing the dashboard and inviting your users through email and SMS to verify their income and employment.

Our no-code solution offers an embeddable white label link and takes less than 2 days to integrate with your application. This means your customers can now connect their payroll account right inside your product without leaving your product, ever. This not only lets you provide a frictionless onboarding experience but also lets you improve your credit underwriting models since you are getting income & employment data right from the source (payroll systems) of your users/customers
