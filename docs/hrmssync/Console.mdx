**Tartan offers two seamless ways to connect with your clients’ HRMS platforms:**

**Console** – A powerful no-code platform

**SDK** – A flexible integration for developers ([covered in this section](docs/hrmssync/sdk))


**The Tartan HRMS Sync Console** is a no-code platform built to simplify HRMS integration and data management. It empowers you to onboard clients, control data syncs, manage users, and configure integration settings—all without writing a single line of code.

**What You Can Do with the Console**

- **Invite and Manage Clients** : Easily invite your clients to connect their HRMS systems, share the employee details and manage each connection from a centralized dashboard.

- **Set Sync Frequency** : Define how often Tartan should fetch updates from your clients' HRMS platforms to keep employee data up-to-date.

- **View and Export Employee Directory** : Access the full employee directory from connected clients and export it as a CSV for reporting or processing.

- **Customize Source Data** : Apply transformation rules to structure source data to meet your specific format or logic needs.

- **User Management** : Invite team members within your organization, assign them roles (e.g., admin, viewer), and associate them with specific clients for better access control.

- **Set Data Models** : Select the data points you require from the corporate. You can mark specific fields as mandatory, while allowing the corporate the flexibility to disable non-mandatory fields, ensuring both security and control in the data-sharing process.

- **SDK UI Customization & Preview** : If you're using the SDK, use the console to customize the UI elements and instantly preview SDK changes in the console itself.

- **Webhook Configuration** : Set up your webhook endpoint and choose the specific events you'd like to subscribe to—ensuring you receive real-time updates when important changes occur.
