Tartan lets you stay up to date with data changes by using Webhooks. You can easily manage and test webhook events directly through the Tartan Console, ensuring your integration runs smoothly.

Tartan uses a webhook system to automatically notify your application whenever thereâ€™s a change in the source system. Instead of constantly polling the API for updates, you simply set up a secure HTTPS endpoint to receive scheduled webhook from tartan.
