### Benefits OS
Benefits OS is a new product conceived as an automated solution specifically designed for employee benefits platforms. Its primary function is to enable seamless corporate and employee onboarding for their clients by leveraging integration with HRIS/Payroll systems in order to fetch updated employee details. This aligns with Tartan's core offering of providing Unified API access to enterprises ensuring safe & secure connections.  

### Why does Wealth OS exist?  

The product exists to address the traditional friction points in onboarding employers and their employees onto benefits platforms. Manual processes for collecting employee data from companies are time-consuming and prone to errors. By integrating directly with the source of truth – the HRMS – Benefits OS streamlines this critical step, making it effortless to obtain necessary information like employee names, status, and potentially salary or dependent details directly from the HR system.  

### How does Benefits OS help Employee Benefit companies?  

Benefits OS provides significant advantages for platforms offering employee benefits -
- It is designed to boost customer adoption, allowing them to connect your product to their HRIS platform in seconds, dramatically shortening the time-to-value.
- Furthermore, by automating data synchronisation and integration, it helps in reducing support hours.
- The platform includes capabilities for setting data sync frequency to automate employee data fetching, which prevents exited employees from availing any such benefits, resulting in reduced leakages.


### Key modules and capabilities include:

- **Benefits Administration** - For Reward and Recognition programs, linking employee directory and details with employee benefit platforms is key to map benefits based on employee grade and department.
- **Incentive Management** - Sales teams incentive and disbursement practices are unstructured and platforms working on solving this problem can use HRIS Sync to link sales team details with incentive structures to automate monthly incentives and rewards.
- **Esop Management** - Employees have varied ESOPS and vesting periods in any organization. Linking ESOP values to employees based on their levels and vesting period in the organization makes it easy to transfer and realize vested ESOPS.
- **Tax Benefit** - Tax declarations vary employee to employee and linking declarations in HRIS with Tax Benefit platforms for employees becomes important to directly manage such investments and map it directly with HRIS for automated deductions and salary payout accordingly.
