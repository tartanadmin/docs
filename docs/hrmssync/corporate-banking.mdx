### Banking OS  

This OS is specifically designed for Onboarding Corporates and Acquiring Salary Accounts. It leverages Tartan's Unified APIs to access data from 80+ HRMS and employs AI Agents to integrate systems and enable intelligent automation. Essentially, it's an automated solution for corporate salary account opening.

### Why does Banking OS exist?  

The system exists primarily to replace the cumbersome, manual processes traditionally involved in corporate salary account acquisition. This traditional approach often requires significant offline engagement between Bank’s RM and Employer/HR. There is a dependency on HR or People Ops teams for account opening processes, and employees face a broken journey with offline KYC and no auto-fetched details. Corporate Salary Account OS removes the need for manual data collection and interaction by providing a digitally automated workflow.

### How does Banking OS help Banks?
This product significantly helps Banks by delivering higher efficiency and productivity. It enables 100% Digital Corporate Onboarding. Benefits include -

- Increased salary account penetration with optimized TAT (turn-around-time).
- Almost zero offline engagement required, and the ability for RMs and central teams to track Corporates and employees about the Account Opening Journey.
- Employees benefit from a Pre-Populated Salary A/c Journey allowing them to open accounts three times faster through a simplified, quicker journey with Auto-Populated Data.
- The platform facilitates seamless corporate onboarding, centralized management, and seamless HRMS integration for corporates. It also improves Fraud and Risk compliance through checks like Real time Employment Verification and Two-Fold Digital KYC.  


### Account Opening Status Page
To further streamline and digitize the salary account onboarding experience for corporate banking partners, Tartan provides an **Account Opening Status Page** within the whitelabelled console.
This page gives banking clients real-time visibility into the status of salary account opening for each employee of their corporate client. It adds a layer of transparency and control over the end-to-end process.

**Key Features:**
- **Real-Time Status Tracking**: View detailed account opening status (e.g., initiated, in-progress, completed etc) for each employee.
- **Bank Details Visibility**: Once an account is successfully opened, the system surfaces key banking details like the Account Number and IFSC Code directly on the console.
- **Custom Field Selection**: Clients can configure and choose what fields they wish to view based on their operational needs.
- **Automated Push to Bank Systems**: Once new bank account details are generated, Tartan can automatically push this information to the bank’s backend or relevant systems via secure API callbacks or file drops.

**How It Helps:**
- **Enhanced Operational Control**: Clients and RM teams get centralized access to the progress of each employee's account journey — eliminating manual coordination with HR teams.
- **Improved Transparency**: Allows banks to proactively monitor onboarding bottlenecks and resolve them in real time.
- **Seamless Integration**: The system ensures that once account creation is complete, updated details flow into your core systems with no additional manual effort.  

This feature strengthens the Banking OS offering by providing full visibility into the onboarding funnel, ensuring a truly digital-first, scalable salary account acquisition experience for banks.



### Key components and modules include:
