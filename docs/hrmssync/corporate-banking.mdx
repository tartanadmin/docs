### Banking OS  

This OS is specifically designed for Onboarding Corporates and Acquiring Salary Accounts. It leverages Tartan's Unified APIs to access data from 80+ HRMS and employs AI Agents to integrate systems and enable intelligent automation. Essentially, it's an automated solution for corporate salary account opening.

### Why does Banking OS exist?  

The system exists primarily to replace the cumbersome, manual processes traditionally involved in corporate salary account acquisition. This traditional approach often requires significant offline engagement between Bank’s RM and Employer/HR. There is a dependency on HR or People Ops teams for account opening processes, and employees face a broken journey with offline KYC and no auto-fetched details. Corporate Salary Account OS removes the need for manual data collection and interaction by providing a digitally automated workflow.

### How does Banking OS help Banks?
This product significantly helps Banks by delivering higher efficiency and productivity. It enables 100% Digital Corporate Onboarding. Benefits include -

- Increased salary account penetration with optimized TAT (turn-around-time).
- Almost zero offline engagement required, and the ability for RMs and central teams to track Corporates and employees about the Account Opening Journey.
- Employees benefit from a Pre-Populated Salary A/c Journey allowing them to open accounts three times faster through a simplified, quicker journey with Auto-Populated Data.
- The platform facilitates seamless corporate onboarding, centralized management, and seamless HRMS integration for corporates. It also improves Fraud and Risk compliance through checks like Real time Employment Verification and Two-Fold Digital KYC.  

### Key components and modules include:
