### BGV OS

BGV OS is conceived as an automated solution designed specifically for employee background verification (BGV) companies. Its core function is to integrate with a wide array of HRIS platforms to streamline and automate the background verification process. The vision is that when a client onboards a new joiner, relevant document and detailed information present in their HRIS can be automatically fetched by the BGV company for verification.  

### Why does BGV OS exist?  

Traditional background verification processes often involve manual data collection, submission, and cross-referencing, leading to delays and potential errors. BGV OS exists to eliminate this friction by directly accessing verified employee data from the source of truth â€“ the company's HRIS. By automating the data fetching step through seamless integration, BGV OS aims to significantly improve the efficiency and reliability of background checks for verification companies and their corporate clients. 

### How does BGV OS help Verification companies?

Leveraging automated HRIS integration, BGV OS provides significant benefits to background verification companies: 
 
- **Reducing TAT for Employee Verification**: Automated data fetching dramatically speeds up the initial data collection phase.
- **Reducing Salary Leakage due to Fraud Employees**: Faster verification responses can help identify discrepancies quickly, mitigating potential financial losses associated with fraudulent claims.
- **Improve penetration into large accounts**: The ability to handle bulk verifications, such as during campus hiring drives, efficiently and in minutes becomes feasible.

### Key modules and capabilities 

- **Pre and Post Hiring Verification Integrations**: Facilitating automated checks both before extending an offer letter and after the employee has joined, by accessing relevant data points from the HRIS at each stage.

- **Automated Risk Flagging**: Capability to automatically identify and flag discrepancies or false data based on real-time data fetched from the HRIS compared to other sources, aiding in decisions like employment termination.
- **PII data matching**: Matching critical personally identifiable information (PII) data points like UAN, Address, and PAN between current and previous employment records is necessary. This can be done using data accessible via HRIS to avoid fraudulent activities by new employees.
- This solution would significantly modernise the background verification process by using HRIS integration as the backbone for data verification.
