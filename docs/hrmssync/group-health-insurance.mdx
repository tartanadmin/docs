### Why does GHI OS Exist?
Insurance Apps exist to address significant operational challenges within group health insurance. These include the manual and error-prone syncing of employee data for group policies, the tedious nature of corporate profiling which limits broker visibility, and the operational challenges in enrolment and endorsements due to lack of automation.  

Furthermore, claims adjudication is often slow and less accurate due to heavy documentation and manual processing. Building custom integrations to solve these issues is typically expensive and slow, hindering core product development. Insurance Apps solve this by providing pre-built integration capabilities and agentic automation, allowing insurers to overcome these bottlenecks.
