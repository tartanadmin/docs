### Why does Benefits OS exist?
Wealth OS exists to address the inefficiencies and manual burdens in onboarding corporates and employees for wealth management products like NPS. The traditional process often involves significant manual data collection from HRs by Bank's Relationship Managers, HR dependency for account opening, and a broken, offline journey for employees involving manual KYC. The platform aims to replace manual tasks with automated processes through an HRMS and Payroll integrated journey, streamlining corporate onboarding and employee activation.
