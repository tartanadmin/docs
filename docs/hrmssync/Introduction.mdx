HRMS Sync by Tartan is a unified data gateway platform that simplifies and accelerates the process of integrating with different Human Resource Management Systems (HRMS). With support for over 80+ HRMS providers, HRMS Sync enables you to access employee data through a single, standardized API—eliminating the need for individual integrations with each system.

HRMS Sync establishes secure, real-time connections to your client’s HRMS. This allows seamless retrieval of organizational data across multiple categories, including:

+ Employee details

+ Dependents details

+ Salary and compensation details

+ Bank account details
 
HRMS Sync is designed to minimize integration effort, reduce go-live time, and ensure a secure and reliable data exchange. 

### What are unified APIs ?

**Unified APIs: One Integration, Many Connections**

A unified API is a smart way to simplify how software platforms connect with multiple other tools in the same category—like different HRMS (Human Resource Management Systems).

Imagine a corporate travel platform that needs to connect with the HRMS used by each of its client companies. Normally, the tech team would have to build separate integrations for every HRMS—each with its own format, rules, and setup. This takes a lot of time and effort.

With a unified API, that complexity is removed. The unified API acts as a single gateway that translates all those different HRMS systems into one standard format. So, the travel platform only needs to integrate once, and it can automatically work with all supported HRMS providers.

This not only saves months of development time but also helps businesses onboard new clients faster, reduce costs, and scale their operations smoothly.

### Benefits of HRMS Sync
    + **Real-Time Data Access**: Stay updated with the latest employee information by configuring a sync frequency that pulls changes directly from the client’s HR system as they happen.
    + **Improved Data Accuracy**: Automated data retrieval eliminates the need for manual entry, significantly reducing the risk of errors.
    + **Enhanced Operational Efficiency**: Save developer time with a ready-to-use SDK, and improve your CSM-to-client ratio by removing the need for manual data exchanges or frequent follow-ups.
