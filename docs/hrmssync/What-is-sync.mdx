## Hyper Sync: Unified API Solution  

Tartan has created Unified APIs across multiple SaaS platforms. As a business, enterprises and startups can fetch and update their client data from multiple SaaS tools, using Tartanâ€™s Unified APIs. This reduces integration time from months to minutes. It acts as a unified integration solution to connect various applications like HRMS, CRM, ERP, ATS etc, enabling custom workflows.

## Why does it exist?  

Companies need integrations. Building these integrations in-house is expensive, sometimes up to thousands of dollars per integration, and it slows down core product innovation, with companies taking at least 3 weeks to bring a single integration to market. Solutions like Hyper Sync help organisations by providing a competitive advantage, leading to higher deal closures, and improving customer retention by deeply embedding products into users' daily tasks.
HyperSync helps organisations by allowing them to:
- Deliver product integrations 5x faster natively
- Integrate with 1000+ applications using pre-built connectors
- Use a Low code integration, automation builder and SDKs to build, test, and launch multiple integrations with minimal coding.
- Automate complex business processes within minutes
- Enable Real time data replication from any source to destination system
- Offer a white-labelled embedded experience to customers
- Ensure enterprise grade security and governance through data encryption, secure logins, security certifications, and role-based access control
- Offload API maintenance and management.

## Use Cases  

- Corporate Profiling and Onboarding (tying into KYB verification).
- Employee Onboarding (integrating HRMS and payroll).
- Expense Management (integrating ERP and expense tools).
