We at Tartan have developed the Sync platform to facilitate seamless employee data exchange between service providers and their clients (employers), specifically focusing on the efficient retrieval of employee information. Traditionally, clients manually transmitted updated employee data to service providers, leading to delays, errors, and inefficiencies. Sync addresses these challenges by enabling service providers to access their clients' employee information directly and in real-time, thereby enhancing service delivery and operational scalability.

**Benefits of Sync**
    + **Real-Time Data Access**: Service providers can retrieve up-to-date employee information as soon as changes occur within the client's (employer) HR system
    + **Error Reduction**: By automating data retrieval, Sync minimizes manual data entry errors, ensuring higher data accuracy.
    + **Operational Efficiency**: Eliminates the need for manual data-sharing processes, allowing service providers to scale their operations and offer timely services.
