Tartan lets you stay up to date with data changes by using Webhooks. You can easily manage and test webhook events directly through the [Tartan Console](/docs/hrmssync/console), ensuring your integration runs smoothly.

Tartan uses a webhook system to automatically notify your application whenever thereâ€™s a change in the source system. Instead of constantly polling the API for updates, you simply set up a secure HTTPS endpoint to receive scheduled webhook from tartan.


### Webhook Headers

Webhook headers are bits of information sent along with a webhook request, just like a label on a parcel. They help the receiving server understand who sent the request, what kind of data is inside, and sometimes how to verify it's legit.



| Header  | Description | 
    | --- | --- | 
    | ``` "content-type":"application/json" ``` | Tells about the format of the data (json, etc.) |
    | ``` "tartan-signature": "xxxxxxxxx" ```  | Security signature to verify authenticity | 
   


**tartan-signature** - To ensure that your API endpoint is verifying that incoming POST requests are from Tartan and not a malicious source, and that payloads haven't been altered in transit.



The signature is generated using a combination of the secret_key/app_key and the payload data. You can refer to the code snippet below to generate and verify the encoded hash using the [hmac module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/hmac.html) and the sha256 algorithm.

``` python
import hmac
import hashlib
import json
# Example secret key and message
app_key = "my_secret_key"
payload = request.body
try:
  tartan_signature = request.headers.get("tartan-signature")
except KeyError:
    print('No signature sent, request did not originate from Tartan.')
    raise
print("Recieved tartan-signature:", tartan_signature)
# Generate HMAC digest using SHA256
hmac_digest = hmac.new(app_key.encode("utf-8"), payload.encode("utf-8"), hashlib.sha256).hexdigest()
print("Generated HMAC Digest:", hmac_digest)
# Check if the generated HMAC matches the received one
if hmac_digest == tartan_signature:
    print("HMAC verified successfully!")
else:
    print("HMAC verification failed!")
    ```

### Webhook events 

Once you've set up your webhook URL via our [console](docs/hrmssync/console") or with help from your Tartan SPOC, you'll start receiving webhook events from Tartan.

You can choose which events you'd like to receive from the [Webhook Events](docs/hrmssync/console") section. Once configured, Tartan will begin sending only those selected events to your endpoint.
<Note> Tartan automatically re-triggers all failed webhooks at the end of the day (EOD). </Note>
