<Note> The token generated is valid for 1 hour. </Note>
<Note> Reach out to your SPOC in Tartan for api_key. </Note>

| Parameter	| Description |
 | --- | --- | 
| api_key |	Authentication key issued by Tartan. **Note: This key is secret and should be kept safe.** |
| email |	The email of your corporate whose data you wish to retrieve. |
| org_name |	The corporate's organisation name. |
| fullname |	The name of the HR admin at the corporate organisation. |
| remote_org_id (optional) | A unique identifier that allows you to bypass validation checks for corporates with multiple domains. It ensures a consistent org_id is provided for the same organization, regardless of domain variations. This is a client-defined identifier that Tartan uses to link users to a corporate. Refer to [API workflow](/docs/hrmssync/sdk) section of this page for a detailed explanation of this API workflow. |


###  Generate SDK Token API: Decision Matrix

**Input Validation**:
The API begins by validating the provided inputs ( email , org_name, fullname, and optionally remote_org_id). If any required input is missing or invalid, the API returns an error.

**Check for remote_org_id**:
If a remote_org_id is provided, the API directly maps this identifier to an existing org_id without further domain or name validation and creates a user under it using the provided email if needed. This path is designed for clients with multiple domains or custom configurations who want a consistent identifier.

**Domain-Based org_id Determination**:

If remote_org_id is not provided, the API does the following:

**Domain Classification**: The API checks if the email domain belongs to a common domain (Refer to list attached below) or a private domain (custom domains used by corporates).  

**Private Domain Handling**: If the email belongs to a private domain, the API ensures that there is a one-to-one mapping between the private domain and an org_id.  

If an org_id already exists for that private domain, it is returned. Otherwise, a new org_id is created for that domain.  

**Common/Public Domain Handling**: If the email belongs to a common domain, the API cannot rely on the domain alone to determine the organization.  

In this case, the API checks if the provided org_name is unique  


**Unique org_name**: If the organization name is unique, a new org_id is generated.  

**Existing org_name**: If the organization name already exists, the corresponding org_id is returned.  

This step prevents the creation of duplicate organizations when using common/public domains.
